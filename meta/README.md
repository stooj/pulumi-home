# GCP configuration

Creates a small project within the pulumi org.

Enables the Google Drive service.

Currently you need to make the OAuth credentials by hand on the
[Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials?project=pulumi-ce-stoo)
page on Google Cloud. This is a limitation of Google's API, not Pulumi or
Terraform.
